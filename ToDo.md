## To add
- Have to attach the delete icon to the object instead of being rendered at a fixed location
- Make the edit button in the viewer to lead the user to the PPTEditor page with the ppt preloaded into the canvas
- Update the system prompt to instruct the model to include open source images in the slides
- Update the backend architecture such that there is an intermediate font that can be sent to an image generation model for relevant info-graphs

## Issues
- Images not added into the canvas
