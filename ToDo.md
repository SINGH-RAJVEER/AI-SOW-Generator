## To add

### Viewer
- Styles should be carried over when exported as ppt

### Inputs
- Client requirements
- Tenure of the project development (time defined by the user but designed by the model)
- Pricing/ budget
- Support service 
- Special legal terms (optional)
- Deliverables(input optional, output required)

### Outputs
- Front page
- Intro + objective page
- Scope of work section, gives the modules overview
- Deliverables section
- Timeline table 
- Budget table
- Payment terms table

## Issues
- Pages do not completely switch the theme until a few slides are changed. There is temporarily a thick border of the previous slide all around.
