## To add

### Editor
- Have to attach the delete icon to the object instead of being rendered at a fixed location
- Make the edit button in the viewer to lead the user to the PPTEditor page with the ppt preloaded into the canvas

### Viewer
- streaming api ?
- Implement watermark/logo
- A template has to me more than just styles
- Styles should be carried over when exported as ppt

## Issues
- Images cannot be added into the canvas
- Pages do not cover the dedicated area unless a few slides are switched
- Pages do not completely switch the theme until a few slides are changed. There is temporarily a thick border of the previous slide all around.
